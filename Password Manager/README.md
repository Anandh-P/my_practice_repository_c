# Password Manager
This folder contains a Python-based password management application that provides secure storage and management of user credentials.
## Contents
- **main.py**: The main Python application file containing the password manager logic and user interface
- **credentials.csv**: Encrypted storage file for user credentials (usernames, passwords, and websites)
- **key.key**: Cryptographic key file. This key is used for encrypting and decrypting the stored credentials
## Purpose
This password manager application allows users to:
- Securely store website credentials (username, password, website URL)
- Encrypt sensitive data using cryptographic keys
- Retrieve and manage stored passwords
- Maintain data security through file-based encryption
## Security Note
The credentials are stored in encrypted format using the generated key file. The key is to be kept securely.

## Usage
Run the main.py file to start the password manager application. Ensure all three files (main.py, credentials.csv, key.key) are in the same directory for proper functionality.
